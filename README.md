## Executive Summary

**USD online (USD.o)** is a new-generation, owner-minted stablecoin on BNB Smart Chain (BSC) that combines the full transparency and simplicity of classic stablecoins with the power of next-generation digital finance. All tokens are minted solely by the owner and always 1:1 with real USD, creating a transparent, secure and scalable digital dollar for DeFi, global payments, and institutional use.

## Market Problem

Despite huge progress in blockchain-based payments, many stablecoin solutions suffer from:
- Algorithmic risk (UST/LUNA-like collapse scenarios)
- Overcollateralization inefficiency (locked value in DAI-like protocols)
- Opaque reserve management (uncertain audits, minting and burning by third parties)
- Difficult onboarding, high compliance complexity for business and retail users

**Demand:**  
A simple, transparent, and truly stable digital dollar with clear minting, simple redemption and global compatibility.

## USD.o Solution & Vision

### Mission

To deliver the most **trusted**, **simple**, and **fully auditable** digital USD stablecoin for global commerce, DeFi, and everyday users.

### Key Principles

- **Owner-minted only:** No algorithmic or permissionless mint/burn. Each USD.o token is minted only after USD deposit is verified by the owner.
- **Full transparency:** All actions (mint, transfer) are on-chain and visible to anyone.
- **No collateral or algorithmic risk:** There are no synthetic mechanisms. All USD.o represents real value received off-chain.
- **Standard compatibility:** Full ERC20/BEP20 compliance for use in any wallet, DEX, or CeFi/DeFi app.

## Token Specification

| Parameter      | Value                               |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Token Name     | USD online                          |
| Symbol         | USD.o                               |
| Decimals       | 6                                   |
| Standard       | ERC20 / BEP20                       |
| Network        | BNB Smart Chain (BSC)               |
| Contract       | _To be deployed_                    |
| Minting        | Only owner (official issuer)        |
| Burn           | Optional (by owner, on request)     |
| Total Supply   | Dynamic (fully owner-controlled)    |

## Technical Architecture

USD.o is a minimal, gas-efficient ERC20 token contract. Only the owner address (set at deployment) can mint new tokens. There are **no permissionless mint/burn**, no oracles, no upgradable proxy â€” making the system maximally transparent and secure.

**Smart Contract Example (Solidity):**

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.24;

contract USDO {
    string public name = "USD online";
    string public symbol = "USD.o";
    uint8 public decimals = 6;
    uint256 public totalSupply;
    address public owner;
    mapping(address => uint256) public balanceOf;
    mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256)) public allowance;
    modifier onlyOwner() { require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner"); _; }
    event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value);
    event Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed spender, uint256 value);
    event Mint(address indexed to, uint256 amount);
    constructor() { owner = msg.sender; }
    function mint(address to, uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {
        balanceOf[to] += amount; totalSupply += amount;
        emit Mint(to, amount); emit Transfer(address(0), to, amount); }
    function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) external returns (bool) {
        require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        balanceOf[msg.sender] -= amount; balanceOf[to] += amount;
        emit Transfer(msg.sender, to, amount); return true; }
    function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) external returns (bool) {
        allowance[msg.sender][spender] = amount;
        emit Approval(msg.sender, spender, amount); return true; }
    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount) external returns (bool) {
        require(balanceOf[from] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        require(allowance[from][msg.sender] >= amount, "Allowance exceeded");
        balanceOf[from] -= amount; balanceOf[to] += amount;
        allowance[from][msg.sender] -= amount;
        emit Transfer(from, to, amount); return true; }
}
```

## Security & Auditability

- Public, open-source code.
- Independent audits planned (CertiK, Hacken).
- No upgradability or external oracle dependency.

## Use Cases

- Digital payments, DeFi liquidity, OTC settlements, remittances.

## Minting & Redemption Policy

- Only the owner can mint after verified USD deposit.
- Redemption via issuer on KYC/AML.

## Compliance & Regulation

- KYC / AML policies.
- Regulator collaboration.
- Jurisdictional transparency.
